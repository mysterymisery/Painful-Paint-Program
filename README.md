# Painful-Paint-Program
HTML/JS Webgl primitives drawing program

This program utilizes Webgl primitives to draw some basic shapes including: Box, Circle, Triangle, and N-polygon(which is a user constrained shape).
This program also includes a RGB slider to select color as well as fill or outline option.

N-Polygon is controlled by left-clicking to place points and then pressing ENTER key before last point is placed.
